			<h1>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is an approach to 
				managing and provisioning infrastructure through code 
				instead of through manual processes. As servers and 
				applications grow, it becomes harder to maintain and 
				keep track of them without treating infrastructure as 
				code. By codifying and documenting configuration specifications,
				IaC aids configuration management and helps avoid 
				undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes.</p>
			<h2>Ways to Approach Iac</h2>
			<p>IaC divides infrastructure into modular components 
				that can be combined in different ways through automation. 
				There are two ways to approach IaC: declarative or imperative. 
				Declarative is the most common and defines the desired state of 
				the system, including what resources are needed and any 
				properties they should have. An IaC tool will configure 
				the system to meet that desired state. Imperative defines 
				the specific commands needed to achieve the desired 
				configuration and the correct order of execution.</p>
			<h2>Scripting Not Enough?</h2>
			<p>Scripting is not enough for managing infrastructure over 
				time because scripts become hard to maintain and keep 
				track of. IaC can help maintain uniformity and scalability 
				while saving lots of time.</p>
			<h2>Advantages</h2>
			<p>IaC provides advantages such as cost, speed, and risk 
				reduction. By removing the manual component, people are 
				able to refocus their efforts on other enterprise tasks. 
				IaC enables speed through faster execution when configuring 
				infrastructure and aims to provide visibility to help other 
				teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. 
				Removing the risk associated with human error, like manual 
				misconfiguration, can decrease downtime and increase reliability.</p>
			<h2>Methods</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Push: </strong>Controlling server pushes the configuration to the destination system.</li>
					<li><strong>Pull: </strong> Server to be configured will pull its configuration from the controlling server.</li>
				</ul>
