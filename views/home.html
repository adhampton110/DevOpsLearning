			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>This repository is used to document my 
				learning on getting a better understanding 
				of the processes and practices used to improve 
				the speed and quality of software developement, 
				deployement, and maintenance. I plan to develop a 
				minimal application that utilizes various servies 
				commonly used in the DevOps lifecycle. In addition 
				to the development, I will release markdown notes 
				each day of findings/plans. The reason for documenting 
				these days is so that others can take something from 
				it and also hopefully enhance the resources.</p>
			<p>This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will 
				cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning 
				and understanding overall.</p>
