# Jenkins

## **Introduction to Jenkins**

- Jenkins is a popular open-source Continuous Integration (CI) tool used to automate software development processes such as building, testing, and deploying code.
- Jenkins is written in Java and can run on a variety of platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## **Key Features**

- Jenkins provides a wide range of plugins to support different software development tasks such as version control, building, testing, deployment, and more.
- Jenkins is highly customizable and can be configured to fit the specific needs of a software development team.
- Jenkins provides a web-based interface that makes it easy to monitor and manage jobs.
- Jenkins has a distributed architecture that allows it to scale horizontally to handle large-scale software development projects.

## **Setting Up**

- Jenkins can be installed on a local machine, cloud-based virtual machine, or a dedicated server.
- Jenkins can be configured using a web-based interface or by editing configuration files.
- Jenkins requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on the system.

## **Working with Jenkins**

- Jenkins uses the concept of jobs to automate software development tasks.
- Jobs can be triggered manually or automatically based on a variety of conditions such as code changes, schedule, or external events.
- Jobs are executed on build agents or nodes, which can be local or remote machines.
- Jenkins provides support for different types of build tools such as Ant, Maven, and Gradle.
- Jenkins can integrate with different version control systems such as Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

## **Jenkins Plugins**

- Jenkins provides a wide range of plugins to support different software development tasks such as version control, building, testing, deployment, and more.
- Plugins can be installed and configured through the web-based interface.
- Some popular Jenkins plugins include Git, Maven, JUnit, and Pipeline.

## **Jenkins Pipeline**

- Jenkins Pipeline is a powerful tool that allows developers to define the entire software development process as code.
- Jenkins Pipeline is based on the Groovy programming language and provides a powerful DSL for defining complex build pipelines.
- Jenkins Pipeline allows developers to define complex workflows with support for parallel and conditional execution.
- Jenkins Pipeline provides built-in support for various testing and deployment tools such as JUnit, Selenium, and Docker.

## **Jenkins Security**

- Jenkins provides a range of security features to protect against unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
- Jenkins supports authentication and authorization using different security realms such as LDAP, Active Directory, and Unix user/group database.
- Jenkins provides role-based access control to restrict access to different Jenkins features based on the user's role.
- Jenkins can be configured to use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the web interface and build agents.

## **Jenkins Jobs**

Jenkins jobs are the basic building blocks of the software development process automation in Jenkins. Jobs are defined as tasks or processes that are executed by Jenkins on build agents or nodes. Jenkins provides several types of jobs that developers can use, including:

### **Freestyle Project**

- A freestyle project is the most basic type of Jenkins job.
- It allows developers to define a sequence of build steps to automate the software development process.

### **Pipeline Project**

- A pipeline project is a powerful tool that allows developers to define the entire software development process as code.
- Pipeline projects enable developers to create complex workflows with multiple stages and conditional execution.

### **Multi-Configuration Project**

- A multi-configuration project allows developers to build and test software on different platforms and configurations.
- Multi-configuration projects are useful for testing software compatibility with different operating systems or hardware configurations.

### **Folder**

- A folder is a way to organize jobs into a hierarchical structure.
- Folders can be used to group related jobs and improve the organization and management of Jenkins jobs.

### **Multibranch Pipeline**

- A multibranch pipeline is a pipeline project that automatically creates jobs for every branch of a code repository.
- Multibranch pipelines enable developers to automate the build and test process for every code change, ensuring that code is tested before it is merged into the main branch.

### **Organization Folder**

- An organization folder is a type of folder that is specifically designed to work with GitHub repositories.
- Organization folders automatically discover and create jobs for every repository in a GitHub organization, enabling developers to automate the build and test process for every code change in the organization's repositories.

## **Jenkins Runners**

Jenkins runners, also known as agents or nodes, are the execution environments where Jenkins jobs run. Jenkins runners can be local or remote machines that execute jobs on behalf of the Jenkins server.

When a job is triggered, the Jenkins server selects an available runner that meets the job's requirements, such as the required operating system or software dependencies. Jenkins runners can be configured to run jobs concurrently, allowing multiple jobs to be executed simultaneously.

There are several types of Jenkins runners, including:

### **Master Runner**

- The Jenkins master runner is the main node that manages the job queue, schedules and delegates jobs to other runners, and provides the web-based interface for Jenkins.
- The Jenkins master runner can also execute jobs if configured to do so.

### **Build Agent**

- Build agents are machines that are configured to run jobs on behalf of the Jenkins master runner.
- Build agents can be local or remote machines and can be configured with the necessary software dependencies for the job they will run.
- Build agents can be configured to run jobs in parallel, allowing multiple jobs to be executed simultaneously.

### **Cloud Agent**

- Cloud agents are a type of build agent that run on cloud-based virtual machines.
- Cloud agents are often used to run jobs that require specific operating systems or software dependencies that are not available on the local build agents.
- Cloud agents can be provisioned on demand, allowing teams to scale their build infrastructure dynamically based on their workload.

### **Docker Agent**

- Docker agents are a type of build agent that run inside Docker containers.
- Docker agents are often used to isolate and manage the software dependencies required by a job.
- Docker agents can be configured to run jobs in parallel, allowing multiple jobs to be executed simultaneously.

## **Jenkins Best Practices**

- Keep Jenkins up-to-date with the latest releases and security patches.
- Limit the number of plugins used to reduce the attack surface.
- Configure authentication and authorization to restrict access to sensitive features.
- Use Jenkins Pipeline to define build pipelines as code.
- Use version control to manage Jenkins configuration files.
- Test Jenkins configuration changes on a staging environment before deploying to production.
