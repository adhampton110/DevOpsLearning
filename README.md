# DevOpsLearning

This repository is used to document my learning on getting a better understanding of the processes and practices used to improve the speed and quality of software developement, deployement, and maintenance. I plan to develop a minimal application that utilizes various servies commonly used in the DevOps lifecycle. In addition to the development, I will release markdown notes each day of findings/plans. The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.

## Getting Started

These steps will allow to run the express application locally on your computer. 

### Prerequisites

Before you can run an Express application locally, you need to have the following installed on your machine: 

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Execute The Application Locally 

1. Clone the application's code from the repository or download it as a zip file and extract it to a folder on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the code is located.
3. Run the following command to install all the dependencies required by the application:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
5. The application should now be running locally, and you should be able to access it in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` 
6. If you make any changes to the code, the application will need to be restarted to pick up the changes. You can do this by stopping the application (usually by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where it is running) and then running the npm start command again.
7. If you want to run the application in debug mode, you can use the following command:
    ```
    npm run debug
    ```
This will start the application in debug mode, which allows you to set breakpoints and step through the code using a debugger.
## Course of Action

The following are concepts I plan to gain knowledge on: 
1. Learn a Programming language
2. Infrastructure as Code
3. Continuous Integration
4. Continuous Delivery
5. Monitoring Software and Infrastructure
6. Cloud Providers

The DevOps stack I plan to incorporate for this repository are the following:

- HTML, CSS, JS, and Node JS for full-stack development
- Github for version control 
- Docker for containerization
- Jenkins for CI/CD
- Terraform for infrastructure monitoring 
- Jaegar for application monitoring 
- AWS ECR for application deployment

## Content Status

- Learn a Programming language: In progress
- Infrastructure as Code: In progress
- Continuous Integration: In progress
- Continuous Delivery: TBD
- Monitoring Software and Infrastructure: TBD
- Cloud Providers: TBD
