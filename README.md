# DevOpsLearning

This repository is used to document my learning on getting a better understanding of the processes and practices used to improve the speed and quality of software developement, deployement, and maintenance. I plan to develop a minimal application that utilizes various servies commonly used in the DevOps lifecycle. In addition to the development, I will release markdown notes each day of findings/plans. The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.

## Course of Action

The following are concepts I plan to gain knowledge on: 
1. Learn a Programming language
2. Infrastructure as Code
3. Continuous Integration
4. Continuous Delivery
5. Monitoring Software and Infrastructure
6. Cloud Providers

The DevOps stack I plan to incorporate for this repository are the following:

- HTML, CSS, JS, and Node JS for full-stack development
- Github for version control 
- Docker for containerization
- Jenkins for CI/CD
- Prometheus for infrastructure monitoring 
- Jaegar for application monitoring 
- AWS ECR for application deployment

## Content Status

- Learn a Programming language: In progress
- Infrastructure as Code: TBD
- Continuous Integration: TBD
- Continuous Delivery: TBD
- Monitoring Software and Infrastructure: TBD
- Cloud Providers: TBD
